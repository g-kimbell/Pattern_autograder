# Pattern auto-grader

- This is a Python tool designed to interpolate between curves in a .svg file.
- The main motivation is for use in grading different sizes in clothing pattern design.
- Rather than hand drawing many different sizes, one can create two patterns in very different sizes and use this tool to interpolate sizes inbetween.
- Similar functionality can be found in the blend tool for paths in Adobe Illustrator, but is missing in applications without an expensive licence like Affinity Designer.
